	ABSTRACT

	This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Hayloft package,
	which, among other things, presents a C++-based abstraction around Bryan
	Ischo's excellent C-based libs3 interface to Amazon Web Service (AWS)
	Simple Storage Service (S3). It is built on top of the Digital Aggregates
	Corporation Desperado package.

	This software is an original work of its author(s).
